        <p class="post-body">Well, the way they make shows is, they make one
          show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the
          people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they
          decide if they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and
          become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in
          one of the ones that became nothing.</p>
